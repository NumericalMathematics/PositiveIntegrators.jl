# Summary

Many systems of ordinary differential equations that model real-life applications have positive solutions, and it is quite natural to require that numerical solutions of such systems also remain positive. Unfortunately, positivity is a property that standard time integration schemes, such as Rungeâ€“Kutta methods, Rosenbrock methods, or linear multistep methods, do not preserve. Consequently, various new, unconditionally positive schemes have been introduced in recent years. Unfortunately, these new methods are not widely available, making them inaccessible to most users and limiting their comparability within the scientific community.

We introduce PositiveIntegrators.jl, a Julia package that provides efficient implementations of various positive time integration schemes, making these methods usable and comparable.

The first MPRK schemes were introduced in @burchard2003. These are the first order scheme `MPE` and a second order scheme based on Heun's method. To avoid the restriction to Heun's method, the second order `MPRK22` schemes were developed in @kopeczmeister2018order2. The techniques developed therein, also enabled a generalization to third order schemes and thus the introduction of `MPRK43I` and `MPRK43II` schemes in @kopeczmeister2018order3.

All aforementioned schemes were derived from the classical formulation of Runge-Kutta schemes. Using the Shu-Osher formulation instead lead to the introduction of the second order schemes `SSPMPRK22` in @huang2019order2 and the third order scheme `SSPMPRK43` in @huang2019order3.

Starting from a low order scheme, the deferred correction approach can be used to increase the scheme's approximation order iteratively. In @OeffnerTorlo2020 deferred correction was combined with the MPRK idea to devise MPRK schemes of arbitrary order. These are implemented as `MPDeC` schemes. 

All implemented schemes were originally introduced for conservative production-destruction systems only. An extension to non-conservative production-destruction-systems was presented in @benzmeister2015. We implemented a modification of this algorithm, by treating the non-conservative production and destruction terms separately, weighting the destruction terms and leaving the production terms unweighted.

Readers interested in additional theoretical background and further properties of the implemented schemes are referred to the following papers: @kopeczmeister2019, @izgin2022stability1, @izgin2022stability2, @huang2023, @torlo2022, @izginoeffner2023

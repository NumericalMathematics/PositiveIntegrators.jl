# Summary

Many systems of ordinary differential equations that model real-life applications have positive solutions, and it is quite natural to require that numerical solutions of such systems also remain positive. Unfortunately, positivity is a property that standard time integration schemes, such as Rungeâ€“Kutta methods, Rosenbrock methods, or linear multistep methods, do not preserve. Consequently, various new, unconditionally positive schemes have been introduced in recent years. Unfortunately, these new methods are not widely available, making them inaccessible to most users and limiting their comparability within the scientific community.

We introduce PositiveIntegrators.jl, a Julia package that provides efficient implementations of various positive time integration schemes, making these methods usable and comparable.
